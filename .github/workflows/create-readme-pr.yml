# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

This README is the central index and quick reference for OctoAcme's project management process documentation. It provides a concise overview of how OctoAcme runs projects, names key roles and workflows, and links to the full process documents in this repository's docs/ folder so contributors and stakeholders can quickly find the guidance they need.

OctoAcme runs projects through a lightweight, iterative lifecycle that moves from initiation to planning, execution, release, and retrospective. Initiation captures the problem, success metrics, stakeholders, and a one‑pager used for go/no‑go decisions. Planning turns an approved initiative into a prioritized backlog, estimates, a Definition of Done, a release plan, and an initial risk register so teams keep scope and outcomes explicit and manageable.

Day-to-day execution is organized around a visible project board (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done), small pull requests, acceptance criteria on issues and PRs, and CI gates. Teams rely on automated tests and linting, require at least one code review approval before merging, and measure velocity and burndown. Blockers are triaged at standups and escalated through defined paths so progress and health are continuously observable and actionable.

Roles and communication are explicit: Project Managers (PMs) coordinate delivery, schedules, risks, and status; Product Managers (PdMs) own outcomes and prioritization; Developers implement features and maintain tests; QA validates acceptance criteria and runs required checks. Communication cadence includes daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, demos at milestones, and monthly stakeholder updates. Quality assurance is enforced through unit and integration tests, security scanning in CI, pre-release smoke tests, a release checklist with rollback plans, and post-deploy verification. Retrospectives capture learnings and convert them into tracked action items for continuous improvement.
